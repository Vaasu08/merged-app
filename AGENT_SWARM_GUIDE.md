## Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Research**
Always begin with the Research Agent to understand the market and companies before applying.

### 2. **Build Your Brand Early**
Use the Branding Agent to optimize your profile before active job searching.

### 3. **Network Strategically**
Use the Networking Agent's templates and plans to build genuine relationships, not just collect connections.

### 4. **Prepare Before Interviewing**
Use the Interviewer Agent to achieve 75+ readiness score before accepting interview invitations.

### 5. **Never Negotiate Unprepared**
Always use the Negotiation Agent to analyze offers before responding.

### 6. **Track Progress Weekly**
Run the full swarm weekly to maintain momentum and adjust strategy.

## Performance Tips

### Caching
The system uses intelligent caching (10-minute TTL) for repeated queries. Similar requests within 10 minutes return instantly.

### Parallel Execution
For independent operations, run agents in parallel:

```typescript
const [companyInfo, networkPlan, brandAnalysis] = await Promise.all([
  careerAgentSwarm.researchCompany('Google'),
  careerAgentSwarm.getNetworkingPlan(profile),
  careerAgentSwarm.analyzePersonalBrand(profile)
]);
```

### Rate Limiting
The system enforces 60 requests/minute to Gemini API. Distribute requests over time for large batches.

## Error Handling

All agents have intelligent fallbacks:

```typescript
try {
  const analysis = await careerAgentSwarm.researchCompany('StartupXYZ');
} catch (error) {
  // Agents return sensible defaults if AI fails
  console.log('Using fallback data');
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned agent additions:
- **Legal Agent**: Review employment contracts and equity agreements
- **Skills Agent**: Personalized learning path recommendations
- **Wellness Agent**: Work-life balance and burnout prevention
- **Remote Work Agent**: Specialized advice for remote job seekers

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check agent-specific errors in console logs
2. Verify API keys are configured correctly
3. Review the main README.md for setup instructions
