- Built with ReactFlow for smooth node-based graphs
- Color-coded nodes representing skills and roles
- Dynamic edge strength based on skill match percentage
- Drag-and-drop node positioning
- Zoom and pan controls
- Mini-map for navigation

### 3. **Career Role Coverage**

- Software Development Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Frontend Developer
- Backend Developer
- Full Stack Developer
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Cloud Architect
- Mobile Developer
- Security Engineer

### 4. **Intelligent Insights**

- **Match Percentage**: Shows 0-100% proximity to each role
- **Matched Skills**: Highlights skills you already have
- **Missing Skills**: Identifies gaps to fill
- **AI Recommendations**: 3 personalized next steps per role

## üìÅ File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skillGraphService.ts        # AI service for skill analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SkillGraphVisualizer.tsx    # Main visualization component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SkillGraph.tsx               # Full page implementation
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Data Flow**

```
User Skills ‚Üí Gemini AI Analysis ‚Üí Graph Generation ‚Üí Interactive Visualization
```

### 2. **Skill Analysis Algorithm**

```typescript
1. Normalize user skills (lowercase, remove special chars)
2. For each career role:
   - Compare user skills with required skills
   - Calculate match percentage
   - Identify matched and missing skills
3. Use Gemini AI to generate recommendations
4. Sort roles by proximity (highest first)
5. Create graph nodes and edges
6. Render interactive visualization
```

### 3. **Graph Layout**

- **Nodes**:
  - Purple gradient = User skills
  - Colored = Career roles (color-coded by proximity)
- **Edges**:
  - Green = Strong match (>70%)
  - Orange = Medium match (40-70%)
  - Gray = Weak match (<40%)
  - Thickness = Match strength

## üé® UI Components

### Graph View

- Interactive ReactFlow canvas
- Minimap for navigation
- Background grid pattern
- Zoom controls
- Node hover effects

### List View

- Detailed role cards
- Progress bars showing proximity
- Expandable skill lists
- AI recommendation sections
- Color-coded badges

### Role Detail Modal

- Full-screen overlay
- Comprehensive skill breakdown
- AI-powered next steps
- Visual progress indicators

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "reactflow": "^11.x",
  "d3": "^7.x",
  "@google/generative-ai": "^0.24.1",
  "framer-motion": "^12.x"
}
```

### Key Technologies

- **ReactFlow**: Node-based graph visualization
- **D3.js**: Data manipulation and calculations
- **Gemini AI**: Intelligent skill analysis
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive styling

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Caching

- Graph data is generated once per skill set
- Reuses calculations for same skills
- Efficient node/edge rendering

### AI Optimization

- Batched AI requests where possible
- Fallback responses if AI fails
- Quick normalization algorithms

### Rendering

- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Lazy loading of role details
- Optimized ReactFlow updates

## üéì Usage Example

```typescript
import SkillGraphVisualizer from "@/components/SkillGraphVisualizer";

function MyPage() {
  const userSkills = ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js", "Python"];

  return (
    <SkillGraphVisualizer
      userSkills={userSkills}
      onClose={() => console.log("Closed")}
    />
  );
}
```

## üåü USP (Unique Selling Points)

1. **Visual Innovation**: First career platform with interactive skill graphs
2. **AI-Powered**: Uses cutting-edge Gemini AI for analysis
3. **Quantifiable**: Clear percentage-based proximity metrics
4. **Actionable**: Specific recommendations for each role

## üìù API Reference

### skillGraphService.generateSkillGraph()

```typescript
async generateSkillGraph(userSkills: string[]): Promise<SkillGraphData>
```

Generates complete skill graph data including nodes, edges, and proximities.

### skillGraphService.calculateRoleProximities()

```typescript
async calculateRoleProximities(userSkills: string[]): Promise<RoleProximity[]>
```

Calculates how close user is to each career role.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
