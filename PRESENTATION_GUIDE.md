## 🎨 Backup Demo Path (If Primary Fails)

### Plan B: Use List View First

1. Show list view immediately
2. Explain proximity percentages
3. Show role details
4. Then switch to graph view
5. Same impact, different order

### Plan C: Pre-Generated Example

1. Have screenshot/video ready
2. Walk through static image
3. Explain the concept
4. Show code if needed

## 🗣️ Answer Common Judge Questions

**Q: "Is the AI real or simulated?"**

> "100% real. Using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API. See the loading? That's actual AI analysis happening."

**Q: "How accurate is the matching?"**

> "We compare user skills against 10+ predefined role requirements, normalize the data, and calculate overlap percentage. Then AI enhances with context-aware recommendations."

**Q: "Can this scale?"**

> "Absolutely. The algorithm is O(n\*m) where n=skills, m=roles. Handles 100+ skills easily. We use caching for repeat analyses."

**Q: "What about custom roles?"**

> "Great question! That's our Phase 2. Users will create custom roles. For now, we cover the top 10 in-demand careers."

**Q: "Mobile responsive?"**

> "Yes! The graph scales beautifully. Touch gestures work. We use ReactFlow's built-in mobile optimization."

**Q: "How do you train users?"**

> "The UI is intuitive—colors, percentages, badges. Plus we have 'How It Works' on the landing page. Most users get it instantly."
